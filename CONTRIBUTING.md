# Contributing Guide

Welcome to the NumFOCUS Security Best Practices guide. Our [Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) applies to this project.

1. Take a look at our issues to [identify and contribute to requested content](https://github.com/numfocus/Security-Best-Practices/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acontent) or request new content.

1. To claim an issue, you can write on the issue "I am working on it" and then you can start working on it; there is no need to wait to be assigned on an issue.

1. When creating your pull request, write your content in `.md` or `.ipynb` and place it in the `bestpractices/content` directory. Reference the `example-*` files in that directory for formatting examples.

1. We encourage references to external material (blog posts, recorded talks, tool configurations, etc.).

1. PR reviewers will add your content to the appropriate spot in the Table of Contents and publish the new version.

1. To move the project forward and reduce abandoned work, if there is no activity for 2-4 weeks on a pull request or issue, someone else will be able to take it over.
